# Architecture Workshop Hands On Labs - Virtual Agent

 Virtual Agent is a self-service engagement application that helps a user access support information and troubleshoot issues in a self-service fashion. It uses the [Dialog][dialog_service], [Natural Language Classifier][nlc_service], and [Retrieve and Rank][rr_service] services.

This lab was designed to be completed during the Ecosystem Architecture Workshop. For additional sample apps check out the [Watson Application Starter Kits] (http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/application-starter-kits.html)
